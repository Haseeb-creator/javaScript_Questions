<!-- 
		15 : What are some common cross-browser compatibility issues, and how do you fix them?
Common cross-browser compatibility issues include differences in the way browsers interpret CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. To fix these issues, it is important to test your website in multiple browsers and use vendor prefixes for CSS properties that are not yet fully supported.

16 : What is accessibility in web development, and how do you ensure that your website is accessible?
Accessibility in web development refers to making websites and web applications accessible to people with disabilities, such as visual or hearing impairments. To ensure that your website is accessible, you can use semantic HTML, provide alt text for images, use proper heading structure, and make sure that your website can be navigated using a keyboard.

17 : What are some best practices for writing efficient and maintainable CSS code?
Some best practices for writing efficient and maintainable CSS code include using consistent naming conventions, minimizing the use of !important, using shorthand properties, and organizing your CSS code into modules.

18 : What are the different types of selectors in CSS, and how do you use them?
There are several types of selectors in CSS, including element selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes. You can use these selectors to target specific elements or groups of elements on a web page.

Example:
	 -->
<style>
  /* element selector */
  p {
    color: red;
  }

  /* class selector */
  .myclass {
    color: blue;
  }

  /* ID selector */
  #myid {
    color: green;
  }

  /* attribute selector */
  a[href="https://www.example.com"]
  {
    color: orange;
  }

  /* pseudo-class selector */
  a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
</style>

<!-- 
	19 : How do you use the display property in CSS?
The display property in CSS is used to control how elements are displayed on a web page. It can be set to values like block, inline, and none to control the layout of elements.
Example:
 -->
<style>
  .block {
    display: block;
  }

  .inline {
    display: inline;
  }

  .hidden {
    display: none;
  }
</style>

<!-- 
	20 : What is the difference between inline and block elements in HTML, and how do you style them differently using CSS?
Inline elements are displayed inline with the text, while block elements take up the full width of the page and are displayed on a new line. To style them differently using CSS, you can use the display property to set them to block or inline, or use other CSS properties like width and height to control their size and layout.
Example:
 -->
<style>
  /* set paragraph elements to display as block elements */
  p {
    display: block;
    width: 200px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: blue;
  }

  /* set anchor elements to display as inline elements */
  a {
    display: inline;
    color: red;
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
</style>
